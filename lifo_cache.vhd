/* This program defines an entity called lifo_cache with input ports clk, reset, push, pop, data_in, and output port data_out. It has an internal type called cache_array that is an array of 8 8-bit std_logic_vectors. It also has an internal signal called cache that is of type cache_array, and an internal signal called top_of_stack that is an integer ranging from 0 to 7.

    The program has two processes: one for pushing data onto the cache, and one for popping data from the cache. The push process checks for a rising edge on the clock and pushes the data_in onto the top of the stack if the push input is high. The pop process works similarly, but pops the data from the top of the stack if the pop input is high.*/
